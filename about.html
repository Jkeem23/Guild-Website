	  <h2>Some background on our history.</h2>
	  <p>Originally starting as a simple guild with the intent of finding an old friend from Final Fantasy XI, Mist is one of a number of Free Companies that have existed since the relaunch of Final Fantasy XIV. We've grown into a tightknit, family style group of players that do their best to enable success for each other in and out of content.</p>
	  
	  <h2>What do we do?</h2>
	  <p>Many of our members come from varied backgrounds within the game, some hunt rare beasts all over hydaelen for rewards, others test their mettle within
	  the game's raids, and others prefer to do more relaxing activities such as roleplaying. Let it be known that Mist does not discriminate in what kind of
	  members we would have embrace our name, so long as one as one is willing to help out their mates, they are welcome with open arms.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Words From Aurora!</h2>
	  <p>"Mist is always inviting new members to come and join our friendly and loving atmosphere. We've been around since 2013, and are going stronger than ever. What started out as a tiny little project has grown into one of the most well known free companies on the server, not thanks to the amount of members we have, but rather all because of how great they are as not only members but as players and people. I look forward to seeing where we go from here!"</p>
